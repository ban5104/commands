# AI System

Build AI system using CrewAI or LangChain for: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Workflow

1. Use `crewai-system-architect` for multi-agent collaboration systems
   OR `langchain-graph-architect` for stateful workflows/chains
2. Continue with same architect for implementation
3. Use `debugger` agent for testing and validation
4. Use `fullstack-api-integrator` agent for API wrapper

Choose architect based on requirements: CrewAI for collaborative agents, LangChain for stateful flows.
